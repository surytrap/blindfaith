	"addonDescription"					"Blinding fog, an amped up horde and a violent storm
	all envelop you in this neverending nightmare.

	Commons are faster and more prominent, specials are plentiful, and
	visibility is impeded by a pitch black fog and a permanent storm.

	Worse yet, you don't even have AI-Controlled Survivor Bots to lean on to.

	Recommended to be played with human allies and the Blind Faith Essentials Collection...
	...or download the full pack and the amplifier collection for a true nightmare."
