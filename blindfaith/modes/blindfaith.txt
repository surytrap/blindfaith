	"Description"			"Blinding fog, an amped up horde and a violent storm all envelop you in this neverending nightmare.

Commons are faster and more prominent, specials are plentiful, and visibility is impeded by a pitch black fog and a permanent storm.

Worse yet, you don't even have AI-Controlled Survivor Bots to lean on to.

Recommended to be played with human allies and the Blind Faith Essentials Collection...
...or download the full pack & the amplifier collection for a true nightmare."
