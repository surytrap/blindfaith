# Blind Faith - A Custom Mutation for Left 4 Dead 2
Something is in the fog. Don't blink.

Blind Faith is a custom mutation created by surytrap and UntotenTheo, adding a plethora of changes to make the game much more difficult.

Recommended Player Count: 2
It is also recommended that you play this Mutation with hand-picked mods from either the Blind Faith Essentials Collection or the Ultimate Blind Faith Collection.

This mutation was built off of ChimiChamo's ["Universal Downpour."](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3038247005) Please support the original creator as well.

# Changes
**Environmental**
- A storm is present at all times.
- Heavy fog is always active, limiting your vision to just a few feet in front of you.
 - The fog worsens when the storm escalates.
- Flashlights are heavily weakened (unless modded, _please_ use default flashlight if you can manage.)
- All glows are disabled. **Stick together.**

**Infected**
- Common Infected are muted.
- Common Infected are faster.
- The standard Common Infected limit has been increased.
- Hordes are larger and spawn twice, potentially allowing them to swarm the survivors from all sides.
- The Special Infected Limit has been increased to 6.
- Smokers are disabled.
- Chargers, Hunters and Tanks are faster.

# Known issues
- Smokers still spawn in multiplayer (we have literally zero idea why, even on latest version) (to be tested on latest)
- Fog seems to be a bit farther away than it should be
